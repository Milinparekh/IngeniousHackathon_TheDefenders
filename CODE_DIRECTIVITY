here all the codes will be available and for that waht to merge and waht to compile first ,everything will be guided here,,,,

so starting it form the arduino code for the basic precautionary alert system for the car .


namely   ****forward collision alert *****

and then there another file "sensors" which is the arduino code for the car back to have the sensor array on it 

there is another folder named RPI where the readme file is provided to follow the steps for the raspberry pi and camera setup

here there is also a file named BLUETOOTH CAR where there is given the arduino code for the smartphone controlled bluetooth car

there is also another file named matlab folder in it there will be the readme's and with that it is our main part of work where
turn prediction and the ane detection work is done ther with the usefull self proposed algorithm 

we have just orked it on one demo video which is sort of idea as it doenst have any masum on road or any obstacle

just a clear plain road.
